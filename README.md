# Project MECCA
## (Memory Express Clearance Center Aggregator)

# Why?
You look for deals when you're poor and/or broke so I figured... might as well make it a little easier for myself and others.  Instead of having to switch between tabs or the dropdown menu on the website, I wanted a place I could go and get all the data for locations in my city on a single page.  Used some of my knowledge to build this project and I now have a resource that I can use and save resources for everyone!

# What?
NodeJS, ExpressJS, Cheerio, Axios, CORS.  Only stuff I needed to build the project (up until this point at least) though I do have plans to include a database of some kind in the near future.  Not sure what else I'll want to use yet but I'm not done learning what I've used so far so I plan on using some of the other features in my already selected packages.
